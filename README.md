# Crypmoney
‘Crypmoney’ is a platform which enables users from all over the world to
track the live prices of any cryptocurrency of the world in an easy and interactive way. Not
only this, the app will also show detailed information about every cryptocurrency, along with a news section displaying latest news regarding cryptocurrencies.
User can even log his portfolio and see his crypto wealth directly on Crypmoney.
There are many apps out there for tracking live prices but Crypmoney will give you all the features (that otherwise, may require you to download
multiple apps) in just one app. We have merged crypto tracker app, news app, info app and
portfolio app in just one super app-‘Crypmoney’. Apart from this, Crypmoney is very light and easy to use for any age group.
Coming on to the technical part, we have bulit Crypmoney on Flutter thus ensuring that this
app runs on every device platform with light requirements. For backend, Google’s Firebase
has been used. All the database is stored in Firebase’s Cloud firestore. For tracking the
price, the app uses Coingecko’s API.
